2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_fpga_1 are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT design_1_i/util_vector_logic_3/Res[0]_INST_0 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>
